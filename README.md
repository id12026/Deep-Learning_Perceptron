üîç About the Perceptron
The Perceptron is one of the simplest types of artificial neural networks, introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958. It consists of a single layer of weights and is used for linear decision boundaries in classification problems.

The learning algorithm adjusts the weights based on the input features and their corresponding outputs, enabling the model to predict outcomes based on unseen inputs.
